## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

Manual handling of real estate operations leads to:
- Scattered data and inefficiencies
- Communication delays between stakeholders
- Increased chances of errors and delays in decision-making

The proposed system eliminates these problems by using a normalized relational database schema.

## üß± ER Diagram & Relational Model

The system is designed around 20+ normalized entities such as:

- `PROPERTY`, `OWNER`, `TENANT`, `LEASE`, `PAYMENT`
- `MAINTENANCE_REQUEST`, `VENDOR`, `APPLICATION`
- `UTILITY`, `INSURANCE`, `DOCUMENT`, `EXPENSE`, etc.

Each relation includes appropriate **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, **constraints**, and **check conditions** to ensure data consistency.

## üóÑÔ∏è Schema and Table Design

Sample table creation syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE OWNER (
  OwnerID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  ContactNumber VARCHAR(15),
  Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```
